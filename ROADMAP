• Roadmap Checklist

  Phase 5 — Automation & Reliability Jobs

  - [ ] Create scheduled commands/jobs for retrying overdue relays (every minute), re-queueing stuck
    Processing relays (10 min), and timeout enforcement (hourly) as defined in docs/PRD/PRD-Atlas-Relay.md.
  - [ ] Implement archiving + purge commands that chunk-relays into atlas_relay_archives, verify integrity,
    delete originals, and purge aged archives per docs/PRD/PRD-Archiving-and-Logging.md.
  - [ ] Provide configuration + scheduler bindings (e.g., Laravel console kernel instructions) so consuming
    apps can register the automation cadence easily.
  - [ ] Add telemetry counters (archived, purged, retried counts/durations) for operational monitoring.

  Phase 6 — Observability, Testing, and DX

  - [ ] Add domain events/logging hooks so external systems can subscribe to relay lifecycle milestones
    without database polling.
  - [ ] Build comprehensive PHPUnit/Pest coverage for every subsystem (capture validation, routing
    matrix, outbound wrappers, automation jobs, config overrides). Current tests (tests/Feature/
    RelayFacadeTest.php:13 and tests/Feature/MigrationRegistrationTest.php:13) only cover facades +
    migrations.
  - [ ] Expand README/PRD cross-links with implementation notes, and deliver usage guides per mode (HTTP,
    event, dispatch, autoroute).
  - [ ] Provide artisan commands or support classes for seeding routes, inspecting relay states, and
    replaying archived relays if restoration becomes a requirement.
  - [ ] Document upgrade/migration steps, including how to publish configs/migrations and run automation
    jobs within host apps.

  This ordered checklist surfaces every major build item the PRDs demand while reflecting what the
  current code base already offers (migrations, facades, service provider) versus what still needs to be
  implemented.
